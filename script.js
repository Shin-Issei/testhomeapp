// The point? This is the home page that I get instead of just a blank page

/* 
    So what should be in it?
    Links to important stuff both static and dynamic. 


    The long shot version of thigns is that I'd have to build an entire dashboard
    app that allows me to:

    - Create new sections and fill them with links.
    - Store links somewere that I can easily add and delete from
    - Create custom themes (write something that consumes the picked colors form 
    a variable or object store or something like that)
